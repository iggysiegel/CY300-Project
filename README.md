# CY300-Project

"Cadet vs. Covid" is a side-scrolling dungeon game. The player uses the arrow keys to move an avatar across the level; each level represents one floor of Davis barracks. For every increasing floor of Davis, the difficulty of the game increases. While in the hallway, players must jump to avoid the airborne coronavirus particles. On each floor there are several doors that players can choose to enter; each room randomly contains either CGR or medical supplies. Medical supplies increase the player's health, giving them more times they can be hit by coronavirus before becoming infected and losing. Running into CGR forces players to leave the side room. The code displays a basic start screen with starting instructions. The variables necessary to play are game_status (which tells the loop what to show), the timer (which corresponds to score), health (which is the amount of lives left), and a few others that support movement around the screen.
 
The project team includes CDTs Siegel and Bolen. We use the modules pygame, pgzrun, and random.
